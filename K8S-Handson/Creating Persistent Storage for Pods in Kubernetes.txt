You have been given access to a two-node cluster. Your objective is to create persistent storage for the pod, and prove that the data resides on disk, even when you delete the pod. You must first create a PersistentVolume object in Kubernetes. Once the PersistentVolume has been created, you must create a PersistentVolumeClaim in order for you to claim that volume for the pod. Once you have your PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim, you are now ready to create the pod.

Create the pod with the image redis and include the volume, mounted to the /data directory. Also, ensure that port 6379 is open on the container. Once you've created the pod, connect to it and write some data to the database using the redis-cli, then use the QUIT command to exit the redis-cli. Then, delete the pod and create a new pod that will mount that same volume. Connect to the new redis pod and retreive the data that you wrote to the database on the first pod. This will prove that the data persists beyond the life of the pod. Perform the following tasks in order to complete this hands-on lab:

Create a PersistentVolume named redis-pv with 1Gi of storage and ReadWriteOnce access mode. Mount the PersistentVolume to the /mnt/data directory on the host
Create a PersistentVolumeClaim named redisdb-pvc with a request for 1Gi of storage. Make sure it has the same access mode as the PersistentVolume
Create a pod named redispod using the redis image and a container name of redisdb. The mount path on the container must be /data and you must open port 6379 on the container. Make sure you mount the same PVC that you created in the last step
Connect to the container by running the redis-cli command from within the container. Use the SET command to apply the key space server:name as "redis server". Use the GET command to verify that the server:name keyspace has been set. Use the QUIT command to exit the redis-cli
Delete the pod named redispod
Open the pod yaml and change the name of the pod to redispod2. Create the new pod with that YAML spec
Connect to the redispod2 container and run the redis-cli from within the container. Run the command GET server:name to retrieve the keyspace that we set with the previous pod. The result will be "redis server", which means the data persisted from redispod to redispod2.
Having persistent storage means that we can use that same volume with different pods in our Kubernetes cluster and access the same data.

In this hands-on lab, to decouple our storage from our pods, we will create a persistent volume to mount for use by our pods. We will deploy a redis image. We will first create the persistent volume, then create the pod YAML for deploying the pod to mount the volume. We will then delete the pod and create a new pod, which will access that same volume.

Log in to the Kube Master server using the credentials on the lab page (either in your local terminal, using the Instant Terminal feature, or using the public IP), and work through the objectives listed.

Create a PersistentVolume.
Create the file, named redis-pv.yaml:

vim redis-pv.yaml
Use the following YAML spec for the PersistentVolume:

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: redis-pv
spec:
  storageClassName: ""
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
Then, create the PersistentVolume:

kubectl apply -f redis-pv.yaml
Create a PersistentVolumeClaim.
Create the file, named redis-pvc.yaml:

vim redis-pvc.yaml
Use the following YAML spec for the PersistentVolumeClaim:

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: redisdb-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: ""
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
Then, create the PersistentVolumeClaim:

kubectl apply -f redis-pvc.yaml
Create a pod from the redispod image, with a mounted volume to mount path /data.
Create the file, named redispod.yaml:

vim redispod.yaml
Use the following YAML spec for the pod:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redispod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: redisdb
    volumeMounts:
    - name: redis-data
      mountPath: /data
    ports:
    - containerPort: 6379
      protocol: TCP
  volumes:
  - name: redis-data
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: redisdb-pvc
Then, create the pod:

kubectl apply -f redispod.yaml
Verify the pod was created:

kubectl get pods
Connect to the container and write some data.
Connect to the container and run the redis-cli:

kubectl exec -it redispod redis-cli
Set the key space server:name and value "redis server":

SET server:name "redis server"
Run the GET command to verify the value was set:

GET server:name
Exit the redis-cli:

QUIT
Delete redispod and create a new pod named redispod2.
Delete the existing redispod:

kubectl delete pod redispod
Open the file redispod.yaml and change line 4 from name: redispod to:

name: redispod2
Create a new pod named redispod2:

kubectl apply -f redispod.yaml
Verify the volume has persistent data.
Connect to the container and run redis-cli:

kubectl exec -it redispod2 redis-cli
Run the GET command to retrieve the data written previously:

GET server:name
Exit the redis-cli:

QUIT
